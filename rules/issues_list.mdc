You are tasked with completing one issue at a time in `.cursor/setup/issues.md`. This list is meant to facilitate how you and I will fix these issues together. Thus, it is imperative that you follow the below procedure precisely: 
- Pick the highest incomplete issue on the list and start working on it. Ignore all other issues for the time being.
- Once you believe you have finished this specific issue, create a unit test and test whether your solution was successful.
- If you believe the tests were successful, ask me for confirmation whether you should proceed to the next issue.
- ALWAYS mark a completed issue as complete in `.cursor/setup/issues.md` using markdown formatting (`- [x]`).

You must NEVER:
- Work on two issues at the same time. 
- Move on to a new issue before I confirmed we can move on.
