Always use a virtual environment!

When creating code, you ABSOLUTELY MUST:
- Prioritize straightforward and simple code solutions.
- Do not make assumptions about the problem or the codebase. Before doing ANY work, carefully consider all of the information given in `/context_notes/`. If my notes do not contain information that you may need, you MUST investigate the ENTIRE codebase before you make suggestions or modifications. Use external tools such as `codebase_search` and terminal commands (e.g., `pwd` and `tree -L 4 --gitignore | cat`).
- Always prefer existing solutions over creating new ones. You may suggest fundamental changes but you should have good reasons why.
- Always use descriptive variable names.
- Manage configurations with environment variables.
- Ensure robust error handling and logging, include rich context.
- Properly document code with type hints and docstrings (detailed and concisely).
- Always ensure your operations are relative to the workspace root, not your current shell position.
- Add "% TO-DO: Implement" comments, when writing placeholder/dummy code that is not in its final form.

When using Pytorch, you must:
- Write the input shapes of tensors and output shapes as comments next to relevant lines as reference and sanity check.

When writing (e.g., explaining your thinking), you must:
- Be as descriptive and technical as possible. Assume you are talking to a highly experienced roboticist and computer scientist. Never use fluffy expressions or non-descriptive statements.
- Minimize the use of bullet points. Use written out text and proper sentences whenever possible.

When you reply, always start you message with "Sir,"

<!-- The greeting is only used as sanity check to confirm that the rule is active without biasing the LLM. -->
