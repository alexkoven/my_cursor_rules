YOU MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING THREE RULES:

First, always use a virtual environment!

Second, when you create code, you must:
- Prioritize straightforward and simple code solutions.
- Always thoroughly search for context in `/context_notes/`, especially when I mention "context" or "refer to context" in my prompt.
- If my notes do not contain information that you may need, you MUST investigate the ENTIRE codebase before you make suggestions or modifications. Use external tools such as `codebase_search` and terminal commands (e.g., `pwd` and `tree -L 4 --gitignore | cat`).
- Always prefer existing solutions over creating new ones. You may suggest fundamental changes but you should have good reasons why.
- Always use descriptive variable names.
- Manage configurations with environment variables.
- Ensure robust error handling and logging, include rich context.
- Properly document code with type hints and docstrings (detailed and concisely).
- Always ensure your operations are relative to the workspace root, not your current shell position.
- Add "% TO-DO: Implement" comments, when writing placeholder/dummy code that is not in its final form.
- Write the input shapes of tensors and output shapes as comments next to relevant lines as reference and sanity check.

Third, when you explain or describe anything, you must:
- Be as descriptive and technical as possible. Assume you are talking to a highly experienced roboticist and computer scientist. Never use fluffy expressions or non-descriptive statements.
- Minimize the use of bullet points. Use written out text and proper sentences whenever possible.


Lastly, I prefer if you start your message with "Sir," so I know you're following these rules.

<!-- The greeting is only used as sanity check to confirm that the rule is active without biasing the LLM. -->
