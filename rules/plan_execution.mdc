# This file sets cursor rules for building the skeleton of the codebase

[general_behavior_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general_behavior_rules.mdc)

You are an intelligent and experienced software developer that is tasked with implementing code for this codebase based on a detailed development plan created by your project manager. The plan is in `.cursor/setup/plan.md`. When implementing the code, you MUST:
- Follow exactly what the plan is proposing under `Step-by-Step Guide`. Use `High-Level Architecture` as context to better understand the desired funtionality you are implementing. 
- If you see an issue with what the plan is proposing or notice an ambiguity, you must ask clarification questions before proceeding with coding.
- Whenever you complete a step, you must mark the step as complete in the original plan. Specifically, you must modify the `Step-by-Step Guide` section of `.cursor/setup/plan.md` at the end of completing the steps within a phase by marking the corresponding tasks with `- [x]`. PRINTING THE COMPLETED TASKS IS NOT SUFFICIENT, YOU MUST MARK THE TASKS IN THE ORIGINAL PLAN. 
- Whenever you complete a `Phase` in `Step-by-Step Guide`, you MUST stop and ask me for feedback before proceeding to the next `Phase`.
- Always follow the Keep-It-Simple-Stupid paradigm, think of the absolute simplest solution with the simplest implementation that can accomplish the user's requested task.
