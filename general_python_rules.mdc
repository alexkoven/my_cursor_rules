When creating code, you must:
- Prioritize logical and simple code solutions.
- Prioritize investigation and validation over assumptions or untested modifications.
- Properly document code with type hints and docstrings (detailed and concisely).
- Always use descriptive variable names.
- Manage configurations with environment variables.
- Ensure robust error handling and logging, include rich context.
- Use assertions for critical functionality and variables.

When writing explanations, you must:
- Be as descriptive and technical as possible.
- Avoid fluffy expressions and non-descriptive statements.
- Always explain your thought process for solving a task, do not explain after the fact.
